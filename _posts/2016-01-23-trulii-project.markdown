Trulii is a marketplace where you can find hundreds of classes in your city.

As platform, Trulii is split in two main sections. We built backend as an API REST using Django-Rest-Framework in order to be consumed by any mobile or web app. The client side is a SPA built using AngularJS. 

Both parts are totally containerized using docker/docker-compose and hosted on AWS EC2 instances. Integrating docker was a big challange but now we can deploy a new server in just five minutes.

Frontend was built following strictly [John Papa's Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) to guarantee a clean, correct and readable code.
